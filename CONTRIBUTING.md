## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. You can create an issue to discuss bugs, request a feature or send in a PR yourself.

### Docs

Please update the README with any API changes, the code and docs should
always be in sync.

### Build

- `yarn build` will build and output the file inside `dist` directory.

Please do not include the output of `dist` in your commits, we
only do this when we release. (Also, you probably don't need to build
anyway unless you are fixing something around our global build.)
